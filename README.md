This script allows you to search Bing with a headless web browser from a node.js script. It's built on top of SpookyJS, a library which allows you to connect to CasperJS. CasperJS is built on PhantomJS. 

This was just an experiment to see if I could automate the actions of a web browser through node.js. I used Bing as my use case since it was simple to play around with. 

The tests show how the script can be used.
